    Received highest honors for senior thesis analyzing over 200,000 Chinese
    blog posts, algorithmically detecting mutations in the Chinese language in
    response to censorship. Completed coursework in abstract algebra,
    Galois theory, topology, real and complex analysis, probability theory, and
    linguistics.

    \section{\mysidestyle Professional\\Experience}

    \textbf{Nextdoor}, San Francisco, CA / Park City, UT (Remote)  \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Staff Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2023 -- Present}\\
    Tech lead on a team building a next generation advertisement platform from
    scratch while gradually migrating Nextdoor's existing
    {\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}\$250M of revenue off of a legacy
    platform powered by Google Ads Manager. Extensive cloud infrastructure
    development to introduce, maintain, and monitor streaming and batch data
    pipelines using Apache Beam in Kotlin, Flink, Kafka, and TimescaleDB on
    Kubernetes/AWS.

    \textbf{Google}, Los Angeles, CA / Park City, UT (Remote)  \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2021 -- Jan 2023}\\
    Software engineer on an infrastructure team within Ads Privacy and Security,
    using natural language processing and machine learning to prevent
    policy-violating ad impressions. Our systems handled 2M+ queries per second
    and combined modern deep learning techniques with multi-tier human
    evaluation pipelines. Additionally, I had a 20\% role building
    remote sensing infrastructure and machine learning models for a stealth
    climate ``startup'' within Google.

    \textbf{Authentic Artists}, Los Angeles, CA / San Francisco, CA / Park City, UT (Remote) \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Founding Engineer} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2019 -- Jan 2021}\\
    Led a remote engineering team to build AI-powered audiovisual
    experiences, including a cloud deep learning server for song generation, a
    C++ constraint/transformation library for imposing additional musical style
    on its output, and an automated Max/Ableton session for audio generation.
    Coordinated with creative and executive teams to balance engineering and IP
    development with artistic and business goals. See \url{warpsound.ai} or
    \url{https://open.spotify.com/album/4ws0VXLBCNhk7tL033xfD5} for examples.

    \textbf{Cairn Labs}, Los Angeles, CA / Portland, OR / Park City, UT \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Founder \& Principal} \hfill \textbf{Jan 2016 -- Present}\\
    Founded a successful boutique consultancy to design and build software
    for clients, with a focus on applications that integrate state-of-the-art
    NLP and machine learning. Managed a team of 2-6 depending on client load.
    Most projects involve a multi-year timespan including the sales, design, and
    implementation phases, followed by eventual transition to in-house
    resources. Our clients have cumulatively raised over \$500M of venture
    funding using our prototyping and fractional CTO services. A small selection
    of notable projects includes:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{i.am+}: A deep learning based conversational UI framework to power
      will.i.am's wireless earphones and other applications. Backed by
      Tensorflow, Prolog, and other technologies. Supports multiple languages,
      extensible dialogue flows, and a custom knowledge base. See
      \url{https://goo.gl/iMvVTt}.
    \item \textbf{Blue Cross Blue Shield}: A highly available machine learning
      inference server used to predict asthma risk in real time from claims
      records.
    \item \textbf{Hikma Health}: An offline-first, mobile first Electronic
      Health Records system designed for the unique challenges of mobile refugee
      health clinics. Currently deployed in Lebanon and Nicaragua (see
      Brotherton et al in \emph{Selected Publications}).
    \item \textbf{Motion Insurance} A risk scoring server for car insurance,
      collecting realtime driving data and assigning ML-based
      driver risk scores at a rate of 3000+ qps (see \url{motioninsurance.com}).

    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Google}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{Jun 2014 -- Mar 2016}\\
    Worked on a small team using natural language processing and other machine
    learning techniques to improve advertisement quality. Led a 20\% project
    related to mining semantic information from web data, which was adopted by
    several teams across different product areas. Built a named entity
    recognition system in C++ and a link detection algorithm that runs on very
    large graphs; contributed to a topic model for clustering semantic entities.

    \textbf{Whisper}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer and Data Scientist} \hfill \textbf{Mar 2013 -- Apr 2014}\\
    Sole data scientist at a rapidly expanding social media startup
    seeing upwards of three billion monthly pageviews. Designed and built an NLP
    service to extract topics and tags from posts, predict image searchterms
    from unstructured text, and target content to users. Implemented a new
    geographic search system using PostGIS that decreased search time by
    90\%. Worked closely with the front and backend development teams, writing
    production code in Erlang and Python.
